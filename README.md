The epigraphical database epidat provides the inventory, documentation, editions and presentation of epigraphical collections. The geographical focus is on Germany. The time span ranges from the 11th to the 20th century. The database has been constantly developed since 2002. Epigraphical Data are made available in many ways: location-based, time-based, index-based, by full-text-search, image-based, map-based, by visualisation of spatio-temporal relations or networks. For a digital research project like epidat, the digital infrastructures like DARIAH and TextGrid being setup are of importance for the tools provided as well as the possibilities for longterm-archiving of digital research data .
